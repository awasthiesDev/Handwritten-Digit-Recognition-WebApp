# Digit Recognition using Deep Learning WebApp

## Overview

The **Digit Recognition using Deep Learning WebApp** is a simple yet powerful web application that recognizes handwritten digits using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset. The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can upload images of handwritten digits and receive real-time predictions.

## Key Features

- Handwritten digit recognition using a trained CNN model.
- Real-time prediction based on user-uploaded images.
- Interactive and responsive web frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Achieved **99.2% accuracy** on the MNIST test dataset.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend/Model:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras
- **Dataset:** MNIST Handwritten Digits Dataset
