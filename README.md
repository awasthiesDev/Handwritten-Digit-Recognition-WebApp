# Digit Recognition using Deep Learning WebApp

## Overview

The **Digit Recognition using Deep Learning WebApp** is a simple yet powerful web application that recognizes handwritten digits using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset. The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can upload images of handwritten digits and receive real-time predictions.

## Key Features

- Handwritten digit recognition using a trained CNN model.
- Real-time prediction based on user-uploaded images.
- Interactive and responsive web frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Achieved **99.2% accuracy** on the MNIST test dataset.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend/Model:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras
- **Dataset:** MNIST Handwritten Digits Dataset

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   https://github.com/awasthiesDev/Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-WebApp.git

## Run Locally

- Open the project folder in any text editor like **Visual Studio Code**.

- Make sure you have **Python** installed along with the required libraries (`tensorflow`, `keras`, etc.).

- If using a backend (e.g., Flask or similar), navigate to the project directory and run:

  ```bash
  python app.py

## Future Improvements

- Integrate with Flask or Django for full-stack deployment.
- Add a drawing canvas for users to write digits directly within the app.
- Improve UI/UX design for a more polished and responsive interface.
- Implement drag-and-drop functionality for easier image upload.
- Optimize model loading and prediction time for better performance.
- Add error handling for unsupported image formats.
- Deploy the project on a cloud platform for wider accessibility.
